### v0.7.1
- (Improvement) Tests generated by the `#[check(...)]` attribute now verify that there are no columns that exist in the schema but not in the model. (Previously, it only checked in one direction - verifying that all fields of the model existed in the schema.)
- (Improvement) The `sql_enum` macro now accepts an optional `Type` parameter that can be used to specify the discriminant type. By default, `i64` is still used.
